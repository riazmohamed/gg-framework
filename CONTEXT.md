# Shared language

**Ultra (OpenAI)** — A local delegation preset, not an API reasoning level. Following `openai/codex` commit `4c9f42f4`, Astra/Sol send `xhigh` and proactively delegate; explicit Max still sends `max` through Codex. OpenAI children inherit the current parent's reasoning selection in both blocking and persistent paths, capped to a pinned model's supported levels and restored on fallback. Other providers retain their lowest-rung child policy. Thinking/model changes refresh the live delegation instructions as well as the request setting.

**Build-render-once** — GG Motion's working loop: ask the few things only the user knows, build the page in one go, look at a few stills, render once, deliver. No planning file, draft renders or checking pass; re-render only for something visibly broken. See ADR 0003.

**Motion study** — A short example demonstrating transferable motion decisions. It informs a build; it is not choreography to copy.

**Support skill** — Instructions for brand identity or source intake. It supports the video rather than adding another creative style or approval workflow.

**Input binding** — Mapping the user's text, fonts, colours, logos and media into the video. Required identity outranks taste.

**Flash screen** — The WCAG 2.3.1 check the final render runs on the finished file: no more than three flashes in any second. A file that fails is never delivered. It is a screen, not a certification.

**Feed loudness** — The final render's audio level for Reels, TikTok and Shorts: -14 LUFS integrated, peaks limited to -2 dBFS.

**Feed bands** — The parts of a tall 1080×1920 frame that Instagram, TikTok and YouTube Shorts cover on an ordinary post: the top 138 px, the bottom 422 px and the right 179 px from y 840 down. Words stay out of them; colour and imagery may run under them.

**Composition-level choreography** — Coordinated changes in attention, hierarchy, spatial relationships and visual state over time. Fixed framing and intentional holds are not universal defects.

**Production depth** — A legacy quick, standard or production preference retained for compatibility. It does not activate a review loop.

**Studio preferences** — Optional, validated user preferences and reference choices. They fill unresolved choices without overriding the user's explicit requirements or importing general coding-agent instructions.

**Job skill** — A Motion skill for one kind of video (a launch, an app walkthrough, a website video, a before-and-after, a developer tool video or one like the user's example). It adds that job's questions, ideas, moves and pitfalls to the `motion` skill's build steps. At most one is loaded per video.

**Idea pitch** — Two or three short concepts for the user's own subject, offered on the single upfront question card with "Let GG Motion choose". It gathers a preference; it is not an approval step.

**Handoff** — The element that survives a scene boundary and changes into the next scene (a box that becomes the next frame, a cursor that stays on screen, a stage opening from the subject).

**Move kit** — GG's own seek-safe motion helpers (`library/kit/moves.js`): springs, arrivals, handoffs, contact, an operated camera and a cursor. Pure functions of time, not a look. Optional; plain GSAP is fine.

**Review-ready** — A legacy independent-review status, not a requirement or claim made by the normal Motion workflow.

**Checklist item** — One of GG Coder's built-in project health checks (tests, CI, security, design system and so on), defined once in `packages/ggcoder/src/core/checklist-items.ts`. The app's full-page Checklist shows automatically detected setup separately from recorded reviews; detected configuration is not a pass. The Agent setup button runs `/init` to create or update project instructions; it is setup, not an audit. All other checks are report-only: the agent changes no project file, and the `checklist` tool records the verdict, date, commit and evidence in `.gg-checklist.json` at the project root, which is shared through Git. Reviews state their scope and exclusions, and can also be recorded after checks requested in normal chat. A result is due again after 30 days. Not the same as a project task, which is work to do.
