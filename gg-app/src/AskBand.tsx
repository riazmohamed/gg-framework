/**
 * The in-thread question band (design-lab: ask-band-resolved.html).
 *
 * Sits inside the reply, full-bleed and tinted, so it scrolls with history and
 * owns no app chrome. Every question looks the same: one stack of full-width
 * option rows, whatever its kind. A yes/no confirm laid out as inline chips
 * read as a different component from a choice laid out as rows, so the chip
 * layout is gone — there is one shape, and two questions cannot disagree.
 *
 * The band is free of chrome too. It offers options and nothing else: no
 * "Something else" link, no send button, no counter. Typing any character still
 * routes to the composer (that is the free-text path, and it never needed a
 * button of its own), and answering the last open question commits the band.
 *
 * Until then every pick stays on screen as a filled row, so an answer given
 * early can still be changed while the rest are being decided.
