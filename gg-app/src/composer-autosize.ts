//
// Measure with the scrollbar suppressed. `height: auto` collapses the textarea
// to its rows=1 intrinsic height, so any wrapped draft overflows during
// measurement, and `.input::-webkit-scrollbar` is a classic (space-consuming)
// scrollbar in WebKit — verified 8px of content width lost while it shows.
// Suppressing it first means every read below sees the width the text is
// actually laid out at, including the overflow decision itself.
