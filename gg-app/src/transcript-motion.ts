 * The transcript's two scripted moves, in the same dissolve language as the

 * Both run as Web Animations with NO `fill`, so a finished animation drops off
 * the timeline by itself. A held (`fill: "forwards"`) animation on a node that
 * is later removed stays on WebKit's timeline for the life of the window (see
 * `discard` in critter-fx.ts), so nothing here holds a frame.
