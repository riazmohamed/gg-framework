/**
 * "What's new" TRIGGER (renders nothing). Mounted in every window via main.tsx,
 * but it gates hard on the `main` window so the modal opens EXACTLY ONCE no
 * matter how many project windows are tiled open. When it fires, it opens a
 * dedicated, screen-centered Tauri window (see Rust `open_whatsnew_window` +
 * `WhatsNewWindow.tsx`) — the notes appear in the center of the user's SCREEN,
 * not inside whichever app window happens to be focused.
 *
 * Decision: we stash the last-seen app version in localStorage and compare it to
 * the running version (`getVersion`):
 *   - no record yet (fresh install) → remember silently, DON'T open.
 *   - same version → nothing new, stay quiet.
 *   - version changed (the updater downloaded + relaunched) → open once.
 * The seen-version is written the moment we decide, so a relaunch only ever
 * shows the notes a single time.
