/**
 * Post-turn tool-result truncation for the LLM message array.
 *
 * gg-boss runs long. Each turn, the boss and every worker accumulate full
 * tool results in their `messages` array — `read` of a 50KB file, `bash`
 * with verbose output, `prompt_worker` returning a multi-paragraph summary.
 * Auto-compaction kicks at 80% of context window, but heap pressure builds
 * long before token-context pressure does: we crashed at 23% context with
 * 4GB heap exhausted (mark-compacts ineffective).
 *
 * `boss-store.ts` already trims displayed history (1000-item ring with
 * field truncation) but that only affects the UI. The Agent's `messages`
 * array — which is sent to the LLM and persisted to disk — keeps full
 * tool result bodies forever. Those are the bytes that fill the heap.
 *
 * Approach mirrors LobeHub (truncate to a char cap with an explicit notice
 * so the model knows content was cut) and Vellum's post-turn truncation
 * (walk every message, skip already-truncated). We mutate in place because
 * `Agent.getMessages()` returns a shallow copy whose inner Message objects
 * are shared by reference — assigning `block.content = ...` propagates back
 * to the agent's private `messages`.
 *
 * We DO NOT touch:
 *  - The most recent N messages (the model needs the latest tool result
 *    intact to reason about it on the next turn — truncating it mid-turn
 *    would defeat the purpose of running the tool).
 *  - Error results (usually short and load-bearing for debugging).
 *  - Already-truncated results (idempotent — detected via marker).
