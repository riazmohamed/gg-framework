/**
 * gg-boss CLI is bundled into a single ESM file with every dependency
 * inlined. This is deliberate — the alternative is shipping a published
 * package.json with `dependencies: { @abukhaled/ogcoder, ... }`, which then
 * pulls @modelcontextprotocol/sdk → express-rate-limit → ip-address@10.1.0
 * into the user's node_modules. ip-address 10.1.0 has an open advisory
 * (GHSA-v2v4-37r5-5v8g, XSS in Address6 HTML methods) that the upstream
 * express-rate-limit pin blocks us from satisfying — `npm audit` complains
 * loudly even though the vulnerable code path is unreachable in a TUI.
 *
 * Bundling means the published `dependencies` field is empty, so a fresh
 * `npm i -g @kenkaiiii/gg-boss` ends up with zero transitive deps and a
 * clean audit. Users never see panic-inducing warnings on install.
 *
 * Reachability requirements (already satisfied):
 *  - ggcoder/utils/image.ts uses dynamic `await import("sharp")` so sharp
 *    isn't pulled in at module init for paths gg-boss touches (boss UI
 *    doesn't actually call shrinkToFit).
 *  - external[] below carves out native binaries that gg-boss will never
 *    actually load at runtime, so esbuild leaves them as bare requires.
 *
 * Tradeoffs:
 *  - dist/cli.js grows from ~7KB to ~5–8 MB. It's a one-time install, not
 *    a hot path; size is fine.
 *  - Sourcemaps preserved so stack traces stay useful.
