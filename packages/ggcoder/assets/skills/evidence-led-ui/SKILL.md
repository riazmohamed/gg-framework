name: evidence-led-ui
description: Use when building or changing web/mobile UI: net-new screens or pages, redesigns, design systems, visual polish, UI review, and mid-build edits touching colour, type, spacing, icons, focus/hover/selected states, borders, dropdown icons, motion, or UI copy layout. Also use when output looks generic or AI-made. Small styling fixes take the small-edit path. Do NOT use for behavior-only wiring with no visual state, copy-only text changes, database/API schemas, CLI output, or standalone image generation; speed/bundle work is lean, legal/privacy review of public pages is compliance-guard.
license: See LICENSES.md
compatibility: Full review requires filesystem inspection and rendered screenshots (deferred `screenshot` tool); web research and device tooling are optional and unavailable checks must be reported as unverified.

# Evidence-Led UI

Pick your mode, then follow only that section:

| Situation | Mode | Go to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One control, state, border, icon inset, focus bug, or token tweak | Small edit | § Small-edit path |
| New screen/page/component, redesign, or "make it look less generic" | Build | § Build loop |
| "Review this UI", audit screens or flows, pre-ship look | Review | § Review mode |

Every mode obeys § Binding defaults. Preserve the project's visual language unless the user asked for a redesign.

## Small-edit path

Skip the design workflow, not verification:

1. Read the shared primitive, tokens, state rules, and callers. Reproduce the reported sequence before editing.
2. Focus, borders, glass, or dropdown icons: read `references/craft-rulings.md` § Control icon insets and § No sticky pointer focus. Find the rule that paints the defect before adding an override.
3. Fix the shared owner, not each screen. Check variants; remove superseded local treatments in scope. Added copy must pass § Copy must earn its space.
4. Run the applicable interaction regression matrix in `references/craft-rulings.md` via browser checks. Screenshots alone cannot pass interaction checks. Report actual evidence and unverified platforms.

## Build loop

One design thesis, one author. Do not blend directions.

1. **Inspect.** Read nearest routes, components, tokens, type, icons, motion, and states. Reuse the local system; add no library just for a look. React and nothing local fits: read `references/ui-libraries.md` and use `ui_registry`/`ui_adopt` (via `tool_search`) for real Bklit/Kokonut source, never a lookalike.
2. **Content first.** Write real headline, labels, section copy, and realistic data (longest, empty, 0/1/many) before layout. Rank it. Delete sections with nothing true to say. Never invent metrics, testimonials, logos, or ratings; label fixtures. Details: `references/direction.md` § 1.
3. **Read the job.** Surface type, audience, single job, risk, platform, constraints. Infer from the project and state the inference; ask only for genuine taste or product decisions. Net-new or redesign: read the matching section of `references/archetypes.md`.
4. **Write the thesis** using the template in `references/direction.md` § 2: signature, type roles, OKLCH colour tokens with intended contrast pairs, spacing/density, radius/material, imagery, motion, rejected defaults. Broad work goes in `DESIGN.md`.
5. **Slop check the thesis** against `references/anti-defaults.md`. Every tell is replaced or justified with "This belongs because…". Run the neighbour test (§ 7 there).
6. **Plan states:** loading, empty, error, retry, success, disabled, destructive; hover, focus-visible, press, selected, expanded, pending; keyboard order, overlays, narrow/wide, reduced motion, zoom/reflow, long and localized text. Apply the accessibility sections of `references/production-contract.md`; the full contract for forms, navigation, data/AI, native, or release work.
7. **Implement** the complete flow with real content. Decision-critical information and the primary action stay visible or one obvious action away on desktop and mobile.
8. **Verify rendered output** (§ Rendered verification loop).

## Rendered verification loop

1. Load `screenshot` via `tool_search`. Capture desktop (~1440 px) and mobile (~390 px), plus key states.
2. Compare each capture against the written thesis line by line, then against `references/anti-defaults.md`.
3. Score with `references/quality-rubric.md`. Measure contrast of real rendered pairs; record pass/fail/unverified for applicable contract checks.
4. Fix the weakest criterion and every contract failure. Remove one decorative idea that does not serve the job. Re-capture.
5. Stop after one revision unless the gate still fails. Gate: **20/24 or higher**, no zero in accessibility, consistency and flow, responsive behaviour, state completeness, or content authenticity, and no applicable WCAG A/AA failure. Small components: 2 on every applicable floor criterion.

No screenshot tool or browser available: say so, mark visual checks unverified, never claim the look was verified.

## Review mode

Inspect code and rendered output. Return findings ordered by impact, each with screenshot or file:line evidence, label (`RUNTIME` observed, `CODE` read in source, `DEDUCED`, `SNAPSHOT` dated source), and the fix. Separate floor defects (accessibility, states, broken layout) from aesthetic opportunities (slop tells). Recommend one resolved direction.

## Binding defaults

Details and fixes: `references/craft-rulings.md`.

- **No emoji UI.** One coherent icon family; reuse the project's.
- **Uniform geometry and one content rail.** Shared max-width, gutters, and breakpoint padding for nav, header, main, footer. Break alignment only for a stated content reason.
- **Control icon insets.** Chevrons and trailing icons get a deliberate inline-end inset plus reserved text padding; never touch the edge or overlap text; logical properties for RTL.
- **Reuse first.** Existing components, variants, tokens, focus rings, motion curves before new ones.
- **Focus is not selection or decoration.** Diagnose the painted layer; one shared focus treatment separate from borders, glass, selected, expanded, error. No stacked rings. Prefer native `:focus-visible`; custom modality handling needs a reproduced defect and the regression matrix.
- **No soft semantic tint-on-tint** unless requested or required by an existing variant.
- **Motion:** no generic hover lift, no `transition: all`, named properties, tokens, reduced-motion path.
- **Intentional type and colour:** see `references/direction.md`. Not Inter/violet-gradient by default on brand surfaces.
- **Copy must earn its space.** No automatic subtitles, helper paragraphs, or footer notes; supporting text adds information the interface lacks. Named-outcome CTAs.
- **No em dashes in UI copy** unless requested or exact supplied copy.
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the accessibility floor** for every applicable A/AA criterion across complete flows; native apps add WCAG2ICT and platform rules. Stricter project or legal rules win. Accessibility is never traded for aesthetics or speed.
- **No unsupported accessibility claims.** Never say `ADA compliant`, `WCAG conformant`, or "accessible" from source review or scanners; that needs a defined scope, per-criterion evidence, manual keyboard and assistive-technology testing, and owner/legal review. Dated legal context: `references/production-contract.md` § 2.

## Scaling: one agent or several

| Situation | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Small edit, build, redesign | Main thread only. One thesis, one author; never split a design across children. |
| Review of one or two flows you can render and read yourself | Main thread only. |
| Review of many screens/flows, or several apps | Build a ledger: rows = flows/screens × {slop tells, states, accessibility contract, responsive}. Fan out read-only general-purpose children (they have the `skill` tool), one per disjoint flow, all in ONE `spawn_agent` call, ≤ 6 per wave. |
| A dated legal or platform claim needs checking | One `researcher` child. |

Each child brief contains: the absolute skill root path (the `Skill root directory` shown when this skill loaded), files to read (`references/anti-defaults.md`, `references/quality-rubric.md`, the accessibility sections of `references/production-contract.md`), the flow's routes and how to run the app, the ledger rows it owns, the instruction to capture desktop and mobile screenshots with the `screenshot` tool, the evidence labels, and the output schema: findings (screen, screenshot or file:line, label, severity, fix) plus explicit `checked` and `not checked` lists. Children do not edit.

Merge: a failed, timed-out, or silent row is `not checked`, never clean. Re-open each reported file:line or re-capture before reporting it. Large pre-ship reviews get one fresh verifier child that tries to disprove the findings. Fixes stay on the main thread (or `bee` children on strictly disjoint files) against the single thesis; run checks once after merging.

## Reference map

Load only what the task needs; resolve paths from the skill root.

- `references/direction.md`: content-first, thesis template, type, OKLCH colour, spacing, imagery, motion, verified Baseline features, INP practice.
- `references/anti-defaults.md`: slop tells with replacement moves and the neighbour test.
- `references/craft-rulings.md`: icons, geometry, insets, focus vs selection, regression matrix, type loading, contrast, copy rules.
- `references/production-contract.md`: pass/fail semantics, WCAG/ADA/EAA context, forms, performance, platform, trust, AI, release evidence.
- `references/quality-rubric.md`: rendered scoring gate.
- `references/ui-libraries.md`: Bklit/Kokonut adoption and Motion APIs.
- `references/archetypes.md`: surface-specific direction and corpus source slugs.
- `references/observed-patterns.md`: measured corpus observations; read only the section that answers a question; keep numerator/denominator with any claim.
- `references/methodology.md`, `references/provenance.md`, `LICENSES.md`: method, sources, standards status, licences, Refero boundary.

Never load `data/observations.json` or the raw `corpus/` into context; open one raw source only to audit one claim. Corpus frequencies are observations of public surfaces, not brand truth or a reason to pick a colour, font, or layout. Mobile/native has no corpus documents; use platform guidance. Refero only through an authorized MCP or user export.
