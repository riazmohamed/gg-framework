description: One output-checking pass for a rendered Motion video. Use motion_check for technical checks and rendered images, inspect them in this session, fix concrete defects and deliver. No independent AI reviewer or creative approval ceremony.

# Check the actual output once

Judge the render against the plan in `frame.md` (its `Concept` and `Language`) and the approved inputs, not an alternative creative direction. The check finds defects; it is not an invitation to add effects, retime the motion or redesign the layout.

## 1. Check the current export

Call `motion_check` with:

- `project`: the current HyperFrames project folder.
- `output`: the actual rendered MP4, inside the workspace.
- `windows`: representative motion/transition windows, each with `label`, `start` and `end` in seconds. Use the video's own timings; each window spans at least two frames and at most ten seconds, up to twelve windows.
- `holds`: only when the video has a deliberate static section (an end card, reading hold or pause you designed), the path to its render-bound hold plan (format below). Write it before this first call; an undeclared deliberate hold is flagged as frozen and costs a second full check.
- `slideshowRequested`: true only when the user actually requested a slideshow; never use it to hide broken motion.
- `range`: only for an export longer than 180 seconds or a targeted diagnostic, a start/end range of at most 180 seconds. Report the inspected range honestly; do not claim full-video visual coverage.

The tool runs HyperFrames `check` (which already includes lint), decoded-pixel analysis with `motion-check.mjs` including canvas/WebGL, and audio analysis only when audio exists. It returns technical results and actual rendered overview, phone-size and consecutive-frame images **to you**, the working agent.

Do not precede or follow it with another lint/check/audio/frame-extraction checklist. Do not call the legacy `motion_review` prepare/submit workflow. No subagent, separate model critique, approval score or chapter registration is needed.

## 2. Inspect what was returned

Check the attached images for:

- Correct user text, images, branding and permitted substitutions.
- Missing media, overflow, clipping and unreadable text.
- The planned motion and timing, including intended holds.
- Representative entrance, active and exit frames for each scene.
- The plan: the motif carries through, colours stay on palette, transitions are deliberate and type stays readable.

Still images do not prove pacing at normal speed or that audio was heard. Use actual playback/listening only when needed and available; state the limit otherwise. Technical success is not proof of visual quality. Missing evidence is unverified, not PASS.

If the tool fails, its check details list each problem with where and when it occurs, plus renderer notes such as undeclared fonts. Use them to diagnose the concrete problem; do not rerun the check by hand to see them. Runtime command details live in [technical diagnostics](../../references/runtime/lint-validate-inspect.md); they are troubleshooting references, not an extra mandatory pass. Never introduce generic drift, extra effects or layout changes just to satisfy a heuristic. If a real accessibility requirement conflicts with the plan, fix the accessibility problem.

## 3. Fix only a concrete defect

A failed check or visibly wrong output warrants a targeted fix, a new versioned render and a check of that changed output. An unchanged export does not need checking again. Do not iterate toward subjective perfection or route the result to another reviewer. Report an unresolved blocker as draft/unverified rather than looping indefinitely or declaring success.

The tool measures audio and rejects non-finite levels or clipping; it does not normalize the file. Follow the user's delivery loudness target when they give one. Do not add audio to silent work or force every supplied animation through a generic -14 LUFS mix.

### Intentional holds

Declare only deliberate static intervals: an end card, a reading hold or another still section you designed on purpose. The hold plan binds to the current video, so an old plan cannot excuse freezes in a changed export:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "videoSha256": "<SHA-256 of this exact export>",
  "holds": [{ "start": 13, "end": 15, "reason": "End card hold" }]
}
```

Do not mark the whole video as a hold to suppress broken animation. Retain any existing meaningful motion assertions; do not invent a new assertion sidecar for every video.

## 4. Deliver

Deliver the actual versioned MP4, then reveal it:

```bash
<node> "<motion bin>/reveal.mjs" renders/<file>.mp4
```

State concrete remaining limits. Do not claim full playback or audio listening from sampled images. No automatic posters, share copy, extra formats or launch packages.
