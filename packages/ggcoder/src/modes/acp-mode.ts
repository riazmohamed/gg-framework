/**
 * ACP mode: expose GG Coder as an Agent Client Protocol agent over stdio.
 *
 * This is the integration surface for ACP clients (Zed, pew2, any editor that
 * speaks the protocol). It is deliberately a sibling of `rpc-mode.ts` — same
 * shape, same `AgentSession`, same NDJSON-on-stdio transport — but the frames
 * are the standard protocol instead of ggcoder's bespoke one, so a client
 * written against the spec works with no ggcoder-specific code.
 *
 * Spec: https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview
 *
 * Scope: `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`,
 * `session/list`, `session/load`, `session/resume`, `session/close`,
 * `session/delete`, `session/set_mode` and `session/set_config_option`.
 * Everything advertised in `agentCapabilities` is implemented, because a client
 * must be able to trust that list — advertising a method that then errors is
 * worse than advertising nothing.
 *
 * stdout carries protocol frames ONLY. Anything diagnostic goes to stderr or
 * the log file; a stray `console.log` anywhere in the process corrupts the
 * stream and the client disconnects.
