/**
 * Independent pre-final review — the Codex Guardian pattern. The in-thread
 * Ideal review asks the acting model to audit its own work, armed with its own
 * justifications for why it is done; a fresh-context reviewer sees only the
 * request, the changed files and the outcome evidence, so it catches what
 * self-review rationalizes away.
 *
 * The reviewer is spawned as a read-only child agent on the session's ACTIVE
 * model (`model` is forced at spawn time, never a "fast" or review model).
 * Findings are injected as a follow-up the acting agent must address; a CLEAN
 * verdict injects nothing, so a passing review costs one bounded wait and no
 * extra turn. On spawn failure or timeout the in-thread review remains the
 * fallback — the feature degrades, never blocks.
 *
 * The reviewer's time is capped by its OWN worker, not by the harness killing
 * it: on reaching REVIEWER_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS it gets one tool-free turn to give
 * its verdict on what it has examined. Killing it from outside discarded all
 * of that — large reviews ended "Interrupted" with no verdict at all.
