/**
 * Verification gate — the turn cannot claim "done" while a promised check is
 * still owed.
 *
 * When a run mutated code files and no test / typecheck / lint / build command
 * completed after the last mutation, the pre-stop hook injects a follow-up
 * demanding the project's verification be run. Exactly one such follow-up per
 * run: a gate that keeps prompting after the model has decided it is done buys
 * nothing but extra full-length final answers, so the demand carries its own
 * fallback ("say which changes went unverified") and the gate then goes silent.
 * Prompt-only "verify before finishing" instructions can be ignored; this gate
 * is harness-owned bookkeeping on what actually executed.
 *
 * Simplification: verification is recognised by a conservative runner-shape
 * classifier (package-manager/runner + test/lint/check keyword) applied to each
 * segment of a compound command. Both error directions are safe — a missed
 * recognition leaves the gate silent (today's behavior), a false positive merely
 * skips one continuation.
 *
 * Second gate — TAMPER DISCLOSURE. A passing check only proves something if the
 * check itself was not the thing that changed. Editing a test, a test runner's
 * config, or adding a suppression pragma makes a red suite go green without
 * fixing anything, and the resulting transcript is byte-for-byte the shape of a
 * real fix: mutation, then `pnpm test`, then exit 0. So mutations that alter
 * what the check ASSERTS are recorded separately from ordinary code mutations,
 * and survive the verification they enabled — a check cannot clear the
 * suspicion that it was rigged.
 *
 * This gate DISCLOSES, it does not block: writing or repairing a test is normal,
 * legitimate work (TDD, adding coverage), so refusing to finish would punish the
 * common case. One demand per run: name what changed in the checks and why, and
 * confirm the fix stands without it.
