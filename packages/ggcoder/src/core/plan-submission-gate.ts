/**
 * Completion gate for desktop plan mode.
 *
 * A run that stops while still in plan mode, without calling exit_plan, leaves
 * nothing for anyone to review: no approval box, and autopilot Ken can only
 * report that GG Coder is "still drafting". This happens when the agent writes
 * the plan into chat instead of submitting it, or when exit_plan rejects the
 * plan (e.g. no numbered `## Steps`) and the agent stops instead of fixing it.
 *
 * When the run is about to stop in that state, the session injects one hidden
 * reminder so the agent submits in the same run. One per run: a rejected
 * exit_plan already returns its own fix-it error mid-run, so a model that
 * still stops after the reminder won't be talked round by a second one.
