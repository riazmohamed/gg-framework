/**
 * Replay invariant: history re-derived from the persisted session log equals
 * the message array the provider actually received (deepseek-harness takeaway
 * #1 — "model-visible means logged", the reconstruction half).
 *
 * A scripted palsu factory CAPTURES the request messages on every call (the
 * sent side). The same session file is then re-loaded through the resume path
 * (`SessionManager.load` + `getMessages`) and the derived history is compared
 * against the final captured request. Divergence means something reached the
 * model without being persisted (or persisted differently) — a resumed or
 * replayed session would show the model a history that never happened.
 *
 * Documented, deliberate divergences between log and request:
 *  - `MAX_PERSISTED_TOOL_TEXT_CHARS` (40k) truncation of oversized tool text
 *    at persist time (session-storage.ts). Kept out of this test's happy path
 *    by keeping tool results small; the exemption is named here so a future
 *    failure can be checked against it.
 *  - Externalized media / display-only rows — not exercised here.
