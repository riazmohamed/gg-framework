 * Resolve a path through symlinks, tolerating one that does not exist yet.

 * `path.resolve` is pure string arithmetic: it collapses `..` but knows nothing
 * about links, so `<repo>/link/x` stays textually "inside the repo" even when
 * `link` points at the home directory. A repo we clone or open is untrusted
 * content, and a committed symlink is a normal thing for it to carry — so a
 * textual containment check hands any such repo a write primitive anywhere the
 * user can write (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `~/.zshrc`), with no prompt.
 *
 * Writes usually target a file that does not exist yet, so `realpathSync` on
 * the full path would throw. Walk up to the nearest ancestor that DOES exist,
 * resolve that, then re-attach the remaining segments: the existing part is
 * where a planted link would have to live, and the non-existent tail cannot be
 * pointing anywhere yet.
 *
 * simplification: this is a check-then-write, so a link swapped in between the
 * two would still win (TOCTOU). Closing that needs the write itself to be
 * link-safe (`O_NOFOLLOW`), which Node does not expose on `writeFile`. The
 * planted-symlink case this blocks does not require the race; the racing one
 * needs code already executing locally.
