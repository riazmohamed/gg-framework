/**
 * Keep the computer from idle-sleeping while the agent works.
 *
 * Autopilot cycles, task sweeps and long runs die halfway when a laptop idles
 * into system sleep. This holds an OS power assertion for as long as any agent
 * work is in flight. Only idle SYSTEM sleep is prevented — the display may
 * still turn off, and an explicit sleep (lid close, menu) still wins.
 *
 * No native dependencies: each platform's own tool holds the assertion in a
 * child process, and the assertion dies with that child.
 *
 * - macOS: `caffeinate -i -w <pid>` — exits by itself when our process dies.
 * - Linux: `systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep … tail --pid=<pid> -f /dev/null`
 *   — the inhibitor lock lives as long as `tail`, which exits when our process
 *   dies. Spawned as its own process group so release kills both. No
 *   systemd-inhibit (non-systemd distro) → logged no-op.
 * - Windows: a hidden PowerShell that P/Invokes `SetThreadExecutionState(
 *   ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)` and then `Wait-Process`es our PID.
 *   The execution state is per-thread, so it is cleared when that process ends.
 *
 * Reference-counted: overlapping runs (several windows, a run plus a Ken reply,
 * background sub-agents) share one OS assertion, which is dropped when the last
 * holder releases.
