/**
 * Process-wide pool of language-server clients, shared by every `LspManager`
 * in the daemon and reclaimed when idle.
 *
 * Two separate costs made LSP the heaviest thing in the app, and each needs a
 * different mechanism:
 *
 *  - **Duplication.** Every `AgentSession` built its own `LspManager`, so two
 *    windows open on one repo ran two complete tsserver stacks over identical
 *    files. Fixed by keying clients on (server, project root) for the whole
 *    process and REFERENCE COUNTING the managers holding them, so one session
 *    closing cannot pull a server out from under another.
 *  - **Pinning.** A manager's map had no expiry, so any root ever touched kept
 *    its server resident for the daemon's lifetime — measured at two roots with
 *    no window open at all, holding ~330 MB between them. Fixed by the idle
 *    sweep: a server unused for `idleTtlMs` is shut down even while sessions
 *    still hold it, because agent edits arrive in bursts and the next burst can
 *    afford a cold start (`firstBudgetMs` already assumes one).
 *
 * Holders are tracked as objects rather than counts so that `retain` is
 * idempotent: a manager calls it on every diagnostics pass and stays exactly
 * one reference, and an idle-evicted entry can be rebuilt without the old
 * bookkeeping leaking into the new one.
