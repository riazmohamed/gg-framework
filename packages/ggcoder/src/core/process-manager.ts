 * and can always be inspected on demand with `task_output`.

 *
 * Anthropic reached the same conclusion the hard way: Claude Code shipped
 * periodic background status into the model's context as `task_progress` and
 * `background_task_status` attachments, then REMOVED both (they survive only in
 * a `LEGACY_ATTACHMENT_TYPES` list that drops them from resumed sessions).
 * Their progress is now a host-side stream event for the UI, and the only thing
 * pushed into context is the terminal completion notice.
 *
 * We keep a small early budget rather than going to zero: the first few reports
 * are what let the agent notice a build that died on startup without blocking
 * on it. Combined with the backoff those land at ~5s, ~15s and ~35s, after
 * which the watcher retires and only the exit notification remains.
