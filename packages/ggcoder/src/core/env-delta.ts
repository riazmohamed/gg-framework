/**
 * Keep the model's picture of its environment true without breaking the cache.
 *
 * The Environment section (working directory, extra roots, network allowlist)
 * is rendered ONCE into the cached system prompt. Some of those facts can
 * still change mid-session: `/set networkAllow ...` rewrites the allowlist in
 * settings, and nothing re-renders the prompt. The model then keeps reading
 * the old list, so it cannot explain why a fetch is being blocked — it argues
 * with a host it believes is allowed, or avoids one that now is.
 *
 * Re-rendering the prompt to fix that is the expensive answer: the Environment
 * section is the LAST cached section, so rewriting it invalidates everything
 * after it too (measured at ~10k tokens on a small conversation, ~120k on a
 * large one, to correct ~40 tokens of text). Instead, append the difference as
 * one short hidden message: correct facts at append-only cost, with every
 * cached byte before it left untouched.
