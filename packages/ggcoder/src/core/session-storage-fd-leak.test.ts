/**
 * Regression cover for a file-descriptor leak in archived session reads.
 *
 * `openSessionReadStream` returns `source.pipe(createGunzip())`. `.pipe()` does
 * not propagate destroy() upstream, so tearing down only the returned stream —
 * the intuitive cleanup, and what the session listing used to do — leaves the
 * source ReadStream's fd open with no reference able to close it.
 *
 * It leaked one fd per archived session per listing, and session listing walks
 * every session on the machine: a real install was found holding 814 stranded
 * descriptors across 211 archives. Nothing failed loudly, it just accrued until
 * the process hit its descriptor ceiling.
 *
 * The test asserts on real open descriptors rather than stream state, because
 * the bug is precisely that the stream object *looks* destroyed while its fd
 * is not.
