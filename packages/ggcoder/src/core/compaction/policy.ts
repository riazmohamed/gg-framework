/**
 * Latency caps on the context window used for compaction TRIGGERING.
 *
 * Some providers advertise huge windows (GLM: 1M, MiniMax/MiMo/Gemini: 1M+)
 * whose pricing model tolerates but whose transports may not: on the public
 * API every turn re-prefills the whole active context, and observed GLM
 * prefill was ~3-5K tok/s uncached (2026-09-22 sidecar log: 44-68s
 * time-to-first-token at 213K tokens). A session sitting at 21% of a 1M
 * window therefore paid a 45-70s tax on EVERY model call without ever
 * approaching the 85% compaction trigger.
 *
 * Three tiers, ALL evidence-driven — this is deliberately not GLM-only:
 *
 *   1. MEASURED SLOW — explicit cap (glm: 176K → trigger ~150K, from the
 *      incident log).
 *   2. MEASURED HEALTHY — no cap: the transport's prompt caching demonstrably
 *      keeps large contexts fast (anthropic: we send explicit cache_control
 *      breakpoints; openai: sidecar audit shows flat 5-6s TTFT p95 at 237K
 *      tokens, zero stalls in 2,000+ turns). Capping these would throw away
 *      working context for nothing.
 *   3. UNKNOWN — the conservative default cap below. Any provider we have
 *      not measured gets it, so a user on ANY model is protected from the
 *      mega-window + cold-prefill pattern. The `cache_health` /
 *      `prompt_cache_miss` diag lines (agent-loop) turn tier 3 into tier 1 or
 *      2 with one line here as evidence arrives — remove a provider's cap
 *      once its logs show healthy cache reads at large sizes, lower it when
 *      they show misses.
 *
 * The model's true context window still governs hard limits (request size,
 * output budgets); a cap only moves when compaction summarizes. min() keeps a
 * smaller advertised window authoritative — the default never raises a
 * trigger that the provider's real window already keeps lower.
