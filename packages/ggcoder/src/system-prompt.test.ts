    // A/B benchmarked at 5 iterations per cell with every generated artifact

    // (100% exec pass, no new dependencies, no turn-cap hits) while cutting

    // despite the longer prefix: stopping at the first rung that holds costs
    // fewer turns than re-deriving an over-built solution.
    // Raised with the 2026-08 guardrail additions (git safety, anti-fake-green,
    // reproduce-first, circuit-breaker, question-vs-fix, no-variants, test
    // guidance) — each line field-verified as load-bearing across Tier-1 agents.
    // Lowered when the public-code MCP sentence became the shorter native
    // `steroids` staple in Research (actions + build-from-samples philosophy).
    // Raised for the alignment guardrails (facts-vs-decisions sorting,
    // batched questions with recommended answers) — misalignment is the most
    // common failure mode, and these two lines are the always-on floor the
    // `clarify` skill then deepens on demand.

    // code first; fill the corpus on approval; honest fallback when the corpus
    // is missing or has no fit). The blunt wording ("HARD RULE", "NOT
