/**
 * A prompt typed while a question is on screen is the user's answer: they chose
 * to say something else instead of clicking. `POST /prompt` therefore has to
 * release the parked `ask_user` call BEFORE it decides what to do with the
 * text.
 *
 * Order is the whole bug. Steering only drains between tool calls, so a prompt
 * queued while the tool is still parked waits on a tool that is itself waiting
 * on the user — the turn sits frozen until the ten-minute ask timeout fires,
 * and the user's message lands ten minutes late.
 *
 * The route lives inside app-sidecar's single `main()` closure with no seam to
 * inject a bridge into, so this covers it from both sides: the release itself
 * is exercised for real against a real parked tool call, and the route's source
 * is checked for where that release sits relative to the queue.
