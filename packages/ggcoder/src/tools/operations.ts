 *
 * Three flags, three different holes:
 * - `O_NOFOLLOW` makes the kernel fail with ELOOP if the final component is a
 *   symlink, so the refusal happens atomically at open rather than in a
 *   separate syscall a caller could race.
 * - `O_NONBLOCK` stops the open itself parking forever on a fifo (a named pipe
 *   called `x.png` would otherwise hang the tool call with no timeout); the
 *   non-regular check then rejects it, and regular files ignore the flag.
 * - The size check bounds memory before a single byte is read.
 *
 * Windows defines neither flag (`?? 0` degrades to a plain read) and offers no
 * path-reachable fifo here; `resolvePath` plus the sandbox still contain it.
