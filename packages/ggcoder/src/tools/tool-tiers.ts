/**
 * Two-tier split of the built-in toolset.
 *
 * Every tool in `this.tools` ships its full JSON parameter schema on every
 * request, inside the cached prefix. A core tool earns that cost because it is
 * reached in most sessions. A deferred tool does not: it contributes one
 * `- **name**: hint` line to the system prompt's Tools section (~15-25 tokens)
 * instead of a full schema (~300-500 tokens), and `tool_search` promotes it
 * into the live toolset the moment the model asks for that capability.
 *
 * The index line is what makes deferral safe. Dropping a schema WITHOUT
 * advertising the capability trades tokens for capability blindness — the model
 * cannot search for a tool it does not know exists. That is why every deferred
 * name is required to carry a `TOOL_PROMPT_HINTS` entry (enforced by test).
 *
 * Tier membership rule: a tool stays core if it is reached in more than roughly
 * one in five sessions. Deferring a tool is only safe while capability-discovery
 * rates hold: measure that, not just the token saving, before moving a name.
