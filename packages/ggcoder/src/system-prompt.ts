 * Code quality, led by an explicit minimization ladder.

 * abstractions, options nobody asked for, a dependency where a native call
 * would do. Stating the rungs as a sequence converts that judgement into a
 * checklist the model actually runs before writing.
 *
 * Benchmarked against the previous prose-only version (A/B, 5 iterations per
 * cell, every artifact executed against functional tests): same correctness on
 * every task (100% exec pass, no new dependencies, no turn-cap hits) with
 * 50–76% less code and 21–38% fewer output tokens. The section costs ~3.3x its
 * old size and still wins on input tokens — stopping at the first rung that
 * holds takes fewer turns than re-deriving an over-built solution.
 *
 * Rung 2 was checked separately against seeded repos (a helper already present
 * that the task could reuse): every arm imported it rather than rewriting, so
 * the ladder makes reuse cheaper here, it does not unlock it. Measured only on
 * micro-tasks — tasks where more code is the correct answer are untested.
 *
 * The safety paragraph stays *after* the ladder, and the closing line names
 * what minimization may never touch — without it, "shortest diff wins" reads
 * as licence to drop validation.

/**
 * Build the system prompt dynamically based on cwd and context.
 *
 * @param toolNames — if provided, the Tools section only lists these tools.
 *   Pass `tools.map(t => t.name)` from the session so the prompt reflects
 *   exactly what the model can call. Defaults to the full built-in set.
 * @param provider — the active LLM provider. Drives the product identity
 *   (`anthropic` → "Claude Code", everything else → "OG Coder").
 * @param environment — extra Environment-section facts (additional workspace
 *   roots, network allowlist). This sits in the cached prefix, so changing it
 *   costs exactly one cache-miss turn.
 * @param deferredToolNames — tools the model can call only after `tool_search`
 *   promotes them. Listed as one-line hints so the capability stays discoverable
 *   while its parameter schema stays out of the request.
