## 5.44.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix silent agent stop when the provider returns empty responses: after retries exhaust, the loop now emits an `empty_response` truncated event, keeps the contentless assistant message out of session history so later requests aren't poisoned, and hosts (TUI + desktop sidecar) surface a clear warning instead of ending silently. Also refreshed the bulletproof skill references.

## 5.44.1

### Patch Changes

- Tell the model what went wrong when `edit` receives `edits` as a JSON-encoded string, and log the consecutive schema-rejection count so retry loops are visible.

## 5.44.0

### Minor Changes

- bc99e74: **GLM-5.3 is now the only GLM model.** Z.AI's new coding-first flagship (released 2026-08-14) replaces GLM-5.2, and GLM-5.1 / GLM-4.7 / GLM-4.7 Flash are retired from the registry — they routed to strictly worse coding for the same plan quota, and the coding endpoint already answers `glm-5.2` requests as glm-5.3. Sessions saved on any retired id fall back to the provider default.

  Same GLM-5 base as 5.2 with every gain from post-training: Z.AI reports ~50% better coding and open-source SOTA on Terminal-Bench 3.0 and Agent's Last Exam. Context window (1M) and max output (131K) are unchanged, so compaction budgeting is untouched.

  **GLM thinking is now a real effort ladder, not an on/off toggle.** ggcoder previously sent only `thinking: { type: "enabled" }`, which silently ran Z.AI's `max` default at every setting. The endpoint in fact declares `none, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max` (an unknown value 400s with that list), so `low / medium / high / xhigh / max` are now selectable and sent as `reasoning_effort` alongside the toggle. Measured end-to-end on one hard reasoning prompt: `low` → 0.8K reasoning chars in 15s, `high` → 3.2K in 28s, `max` → 24.9K in 129s. The default stays `max`, matching what the server was already doing, so existing behaviour is unchanged — but dialing effort _down_ is now possible for the first time.

  Note `max` is kept as `max` on the wire for GLM rather than remapped to `xhigh` the way OpenAI-compatible efforts are: GLM spells its own top rung `max`.

  With no low-cost GLM sibling left, compaction-summary and scout sub-agent routing keep GLM-5.3 instead of downshifting — the existing graceful fallback, no crash and no cross-provider jump.

## 5.43.0

### Minor Changes

- Add an explicit code-minimization ladder to the Code Quality prompt section, and a `hook_armed` event so clients can hold a candidate final answer back until the Ideal review decides.

  The ladder is ordered and stop-at-first-hit (YAGNI, reuse what the repo already has, standard library, native platform feature, installed dependency, one line, then the minimum code that works). Benchmarked A/B against the previous prose-only section — 5 iterations per cell, every artifact executed against functional tests — it holds correctness (100% exec pass, no new dependencies, no turn-cap hits) while producing 50-76% less code and 21-38% fewer output tokens. Safety is explicitly exempt: input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, and anything explicitly requested are never minimized away.

  `hook_armed` fires on both edges as soon as a run crosses the Ideal-review gate, before the candidate final answer streams, so a client renders hook then reviewed answer instead of flashing a draft it deletes.

## 5.42.0

### Minor Changes

- Add per-repo MCP trust: adding a project-scope MCP server now auto-trusts that repo so its `.gg/mcp.json` servers connect on next load without enabling the global `trustProjectMcpServers` toggle.

## 5.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f49c4a: Add a bundled `bulletproof` skill that hardens what you are shipping against a real attacker, on any target — web, API, CLI, desktop, mobile, embedded, smart contract, ML pipeline, or game. It profiles the attack surface from the code, ranks by what actually breaches small teams (exposed secrets, missing authorization at the data layer, supply-chain and install-time execution) rather than by what is most interesting, builds the control instead of describing it, and leaves a regression test and CI gate behind. It never certifies software as secure and never produces exploit code.

  Its references cover the 2026 threat landscape — AI-orchestrated intrusion, self-propagating registry worms, slopsquatted packages, CI cache poisoning — plus per-platform playbooks, agent/LLM/MCP surfaces, and the secure defaults to write the first time. Every dated claim carries a verified/snapshot/uncertain marker so stale advisories are not asserted as current.

  **The `/bullet-proof` slash command is removed** — it is now the `bulletproof` skill. The skill routes itself, so security review no longer depends on remembering a command, and it also fires inline while you build instead of only after. One source of truth instead of a command prompt that drifts from it.

  Security defaults are also always on: the system prompt now tells the agent to write the safe version during normal feature work — treat external input as hostile, parameterize queries, authorize at the data layer, never commit or log a secret, confirm a dependency exists before adding it, and never silently weaken a security control.

## 5.40.1

### Patch Changes

- 356db7d: Make replies answerable at a glance: the "How to Talk" section now reserves markdown blockquotes for the one thing only the user can decide (`> **<the ask>?** <what happens next>`) and forbids them everywhere else, so a `>` in a reply always means "you're up". Adds a compression rule (reasoning, findings, and history earn a clause only when they change the next move) and a plain-language rule: keep the exact term or identifier, but say what it does or risks in the same sentence the first time it appears, so a reply is answerable without knowing the codebase. Overlapping progress/scannability lines were folded together to pay for part of the added length.

  The rules are also reconciled so they can't pull the model in two directions: the ask defers to How to Work's single stop list instead of publishing a second one, the sentence cap says what it counts (prose — not a step list or the ask), and mid-turn speech is gated on "the plan changes" so a bare finding can't both trigger a message and be cut for not changing the next move. A new test locks all four in place.

## 5.40.0

### Minor Changes

- f56f240: Add a bundled `compliance-guard` skill that reviews what you are shipping for legal, privacy, and regulatory exposure — profiling the product from its own code, mapping observable facts to the obligations they trigger, flagging the litigation patterns that actually hit small teams, and saying plainly when a feature cannot lawfully ship as described. It never certifies compliance and routes genuinely legal questions to a lawyer.

  Skill routing now also damps unnecessary invocation: match the work rather than the topic, skip routine or narrow changes, and never re-invoke a skill already loaded in the conversation.

## 5.39.4

### Patch Changes

- Keep long runs alive across cross-process OAuth token rotation, stop the debug log from wedging just under its size cap, retry provider timeouts that carry no error code, render the full MCP content-block union including images, theme the TUI banner and tool output instead of hardcoding dark hexes, and offer the OAuth paste route immediately on headless hosts.

## 5.39.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix the `code_nav` file outline: list symbols in document order instead of the language server's name-grouped order, and drop locals declared inside function bodies so real declarations are no longer buried or truncated away. `definition`, `references` and `hover` now also resolve from a symbol name alone, with no line number required.

## 5.39.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the `code_nav` language-server tool (definition, references, file outline, hover), tier rarely used built-in tool schemas behind `tool_search` to cut per-request tokens, widen `code_search` to Python, Go, Rust, Java and C#, and fix `grep` recall so dot-directories are searched and `.gitignore` is honoured.

## 5.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e8efde: Make sub-agent delegation reliable: ship six bundled agents (bee, owl, researcher, worker, auditor, skeptic) on every install instead of seeding two into `~/.gg/agents`, compose a child's prompt from its agent body PLUS the Tools, project context, return contract and Environment sections rather than replacing everything, resolve a child's model from explicit `model:` frontmatter (`inherit` by default) instead of silently downgrading read-only agents to the cheap tier, expose the agent roster in `spawn_agent`'s schema, validate `tools:` names, and align wait/output budgets with the child's real timeout.

## 5.36.0

### Minor Changes

- Extend the rank ladder from 50 to 1000 levels with 145 named ranks across 29 tiers. Levels 1-50 keep their exact names, tiers, and XP costs, so existing progress is never re-ranked; past level 50 the XP curve switches from the exponential to a steady ramp that starts at the level-50 step and grows to ~3.6k per level.

## 5.35.1

### Patch Changes

- 8e124fd: Fix "no low surrogate in string" / Bad Request errors from Anthropic and OpenAI.

  An unpaired UTF-16 surrogate anywhere in the conversation (a model streaming a
  split emoji inside tool-call arguments, or a character-indexed truncation that
  cut an astral character in half) made the JSON request body unparseable for
  every provider — and it persisted in history, so retries and model switches
  failed identically.

  `stream()` now scrubs lone surrogates from all messages at the single provider
  boundary, and the tool-result/shell/web-fetch/grep truncation paths cut on
  character boundaries instead of splitting surrogate pairs.

## 5.35.0

### Minor Changes

- 3b9705d: Share MCP connections and language servers across sessions instead of spawning a set per session.

  A daemon runs many sessions at once — one per window, plus Ken chat and Ken autopilot within each — and each used to spawn its own child process for every MCP server and every language server. Measured on a four-window daemon: 34 processes and 3.3 GB, most of it identical work duplicated.
  - **MCP connections are now pooled per process** and reference counted, so one stdio child serves every session and exits when the last releases it. Sharing is the default for stdio servers; `shared: false` opts out a server that keeps per-caller state, and HTTP servers are never pooled because their auth and session id are per-connection. Elicitation is routed to the session whose tool call is in flight, and cancelled rather than guessed when that is ambiguous. A pooled server that exits on its own is retired from the pool, so the next session reconnects instead of inheriting a dead connection.
  - **Language servers are now pooled per (server, project root)**, so two windows open on one repo share a single tsserver stack instead of running two. Servers left unused for five minutes are reclaimed, which also releases roots that no window has open.
  - **tsserver runs two processes per root instead of four**, by disabling the syntax server and automatic typing acquisition — both exist for an interactive editor and are unused here — and caps its heap at the VS Code default.

## 5.23.3

### Patch Changes

- 1be7250: Fix Windows compatibility across project discovery, shell execution, MCP and LSP.
  - **Projects and sessions were invisible on Windows.** Every cwd extractor in
    project discovery gated on `cwd.startsWith("/")`, so a `C:\…` session header
    was rejected, discovery fell back to the lossy directory-name decode, and the
    project silently vanished from the picker. Absolute-path detection is now
    platform-agnostic (`C:\…`, `\\server\share\…`, `/…`), and both fallback
    decoders reconstruct real Windows paths.
  - **Extended-length paths no longer duplicate a project.** A cwd recorded as
    `\\?\C:\proj` (what Rust's `canonicalize()` produces) is normalized to its
    plain form on read, matching what `encodeCwd` already did on write.
  - **`persist` bash mode was completely broken on Windows.** It spawned a bare
    `bash`, but Git for Windows puts `cmd\` on PATH and `bash.exe` in `bin\`, so
    the spawn was always ENOENT. It now reuses the resolved shell, and no longer
    detaches on Windows (which only orphaned the shell past a crash).
  - **MCP stdio servers configured with `npx` never connected.** The MCP SDK
    spawns with `shell: false` and Windows' `CreateProcess` ignores `PATHEXT`, so
    the near-universal `{"command": "npx"}` config failed with an opaque
    "Connection closed". The command is now resolved across PATH × PATHEXT.
  - **LSP inline diagnostics never appeared on Windows.** Diagnostics are cached
    by `file://` URI; ours kept the drive letter's case while servers emit the
    lowercase form, so every lookup missed and LSP degraded silently.
  - **Background processes survived cancellation.** `killProcessTree` used a
    POSIX-only negative pid, leaving a timed-out command's whole descendant tree
    running. It now uses `taskkill /T /F`, resolved from `SystemRoot` rather than
    PATH.
  - `find`/`grep` glob patterns containing backslashes now match (backslash is
    picomatch's escape character, never a separator).
  - **Session persistence was broken on Windows.** `syncFile` opened the file
    read-only (`"r"`) and then called `fsync`, but Windows implements fsync as
    `FlushFileBuffers`, which requires a handle with WRITE access and fails with
    `EPERM` on a read-only one. Every durable session write funnels through that
    helper, so saving sessions, archiving cold sessions and writing redirects all
    threw. It now opens `"r+"`, and a failed flush is non-fatal (network shares
    and container overlays can reject fsync outright — losing durability there is
    acceptable, refusing to save the user's session is not).

## 5.23.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix named sub-agents receiving no MCP tools: a session with a `tools:` allow-list skipped MCP entirely unless an MCP whitelist was also set, so an agent listing `mcp__kencode-search__searchCode` silently fell back to training data. The whitelist is now derived from the agent definition and forwarded through every spawn path. Also removes the v5.22.6 seeded `auditor.md`/`skeptic.md` that shadowed the richer bundled agents, with hash-gated cleanup that leaves user-edited files untouched.

## 5.23.1

### Patch Changes

- fb85e4f: Fix Claude Opus 5's thinking-level cycle and retire Claude Opus 4.8. `thinking-level.ts` kept its own hardcoded Anthropic regexes, so Opus 5 was not recognised as adaptive and collapsed to a single non-cycling `max` level; it now exposes the full low → medium → high → xhigh → max ladder. Opus 4.8 is removed from the model registry, footers, provider descriptions, and the hardcoded JSON/RPC/sidecar/CLI defaults (all now `claude-opus-5`); gg-ai keeps wire-format support for the `claude-opus-4-8` ID since Anthropic still serves it. Also gave the Sol/Terra policy tests real timeouts so they stop flaking at vitest's 5s default.

Opus 4.8 stays registered as a legacy option.

## 5.22.5

### Patch Changes

- Proactive OAuth token refresh at a lifetime-scaled threshold. Short-lived tokens (e.g. Kimi's 15-minute access token) now refresh at their halfway point instead of riding to the expiry cliff, eliminating the recurring 401s and the misleading "API Key appears invalid" run failures caused by concurrent-session refresh races. Ported from MoonshotAI/kimi-code's OAuthManager: refresh when within max(300s, lifetime × 0.5) of expiry.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.22.5

## 5.22.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix memory tools killing the turn when the model sends content over the 600-character limit (over-limit input is now an ordinary, actionable tool error instead of a fatal "repeatedly issued invalid arguments" failure), make chat agents save durable memories proactively without being asked, fix false stream stalls for silent OpenAI reasoning, and anchor transcript error markers to persisted messages so resumed errors render at the bottom.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.22.2

## 5.22.1

### Patch Changes

- Reliability fixes from the baseline harness (bench/baseline):
  - **Truncated-stream guard (gg-ai):** a clean stream close with no terminal event (no `message_stop` / `finish_reason`) now throws a retryable `ProviderError(504)` instead of silently returning partial text as a phantom-complete `end_turn`. Applies to both the Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers.
  - **Sidecar bounds (ggcoder):** inbound HTTP bodies capped at 10 MB (413) via `readCappedBody`; the `~/.gg` progress `fs.watch` handle is now closed on shutdown; the project-file glob search streams and bails after 50k entries. Closes three unbounded-memory/leak paths.
  - **Cap-divergence marker (gg-agent):** `capToolResults`/`capTurnToolResults` now stamp `ToolResult.capped = { originalChars, keptChars, scope }` when they trim, so the event-transcript vs model-input divergence is programmatically visible. Internal metadata only — never serialized to the provider.
  - **Empty-part serializer fix (gg-ai):** `toAnthropicMessages` no longer emits empty text parts (user `""`, user `{text:""}`, settled assistant `""`), eliminating live Anthropic 400 "text content blocks must be non-empty" failures.
  - **Tool-id remap fix (gg-ai):** `remapToolCallId` now strips the full `toolu_` prefix (`slice(6)`), mapping `toolu_01ABC` → clean `call_01ABC` instead of the lossy double-underscore `call__01ABC`.

## 5.22.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Kimi (Moonshot) subscription usage tracking — the usage meter now reports Kimi For Coding plan quota (weekly + rate windows) alongside Anthropic and OpenAI.

- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.22.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.22.0

## 5.21.0

### Minor Changes

- Kimi K3 gains its full low/high/max thinking ladder with an endpoint-aware default (high on the Kimi For Coding OAuth endpoint, matching the official CLI's plan-usage profile; max on the public API), thinking can now be fully disabled via the nested toggle, and context compaction no longer blows past the model's window on oversized turns.

### Patch Changes

- 5fb6b62: Automatically enforce session retention across desktop, CLI, and chat-agent stores, compress inactive transcripts after seven days, and cap persisted tool output at 40,000 characters.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.19.2

## 5.19.1

### Patch Changes

- Cut OpenAI token burn: percentage-only compaction thresholds on authoritative provider usage, a per-turn aggregate tool-result budget that trims parallel fan-out context bombs, cheap stale tool-output pruning (superseded reads and old outputs stubbed before compaction), and autopilot now suppresses the redundant Ideal self-review while Ken owns verification.

## 5.9.5

### Patch Changes

- Add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna models to the registry; remove GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini, and GPT-5.3 Codex. Fix provider error hints to reference the model selector instead of CLI-only slash commands so they work in both the desktop app and the CLI.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.9.5

## 5.9.4

### Patch Changes

- Auto-recover from context-overflow errors in the desktop app (request_too_large / 413) by wiring force-compaction + retry into AgentSession, add explicit 413 guidance, and rebrand user-facing error text to "GG Coder".

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.9.4
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.9.4

## 5.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Gemini models over Code Assist OAuth: use the GA IDs from gemini-cli (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, wire name `gemini-3-flash` for Gemini 3.5 Flash), add Gemini 3.1 Pro (Preview) to the registry, and surface account-gated 404s as a clear entitlement message with actionable guidance instead of a raw provider error body.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.9.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.9.3

## 5.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix retroactive XP seeding so heavy prior users spread across levels 15-25 instead of all clamping onto level 15. Full credit up to level 15, then diminishing returns beyond, hard-capped at level 25.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.9.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.9.1

## 5.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Hash-anchored span edits and opt-in persistent bash session. The edit tool gains a `{ span, lines }` form: pin a line range by its line+hash anchors from a `read` with `anchors:true` and supply only the replacement lines — no retyping existing code, stale files rejected before any write. Benchmarked on Sonnet 5 at −19% output tokens overall and −76% on repetitive code, with equal correctness. The bash tool gains `persist: true`: commands run in a long-lived session shell where cd, env vars, and shell state survive across calls (~0.3ms vs ~6.4ms per-call overhead).

## 5.8.8

### Patch Changes

- Fix transient Ken sessions leaking to the session store (compact() and newSession() now respect the transient flag), harden autopilot verdict parsing to recover a buried line-start PROMPT keyword, and tighten Ken's autopilot contract so reasoning prose never precedes the verdict.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.8
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.8
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.8

## 5.8.7

### Patch Changes

- Cut MCP server memory: resolve stdio servers to their real bin (via the npx on-demand cache and sole-bin matching) instead of falling back to the ~90 MB npx wrapper per connection. Covers non-bundled defaults like zai and any user-added MCP.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.7
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.7
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.7

## 5.8.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix autopilot leaking the raw HUMAN verdict reason and teach Ken GG Coder's own capabilities so his guidance is grounded in what the tool can actually do.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.6
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.6
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.6

## 5.8.5

### Patch Changes

- Autopilot now tells GG Coder when no human is watching: injected review prompts carry a situational-awareness preamble so the agent self-verifies its work and stops asking permission for safe, already-implied steps, while the transcript and resumed sessions still show Ken's clean instruction.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.5
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.5
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.5

## 5.8.4

### Patch Changes

- Route read-only scout sub-agents (recon/research) to each provider's fast/cheap model via `costTier`, cutting sub-agent latency and spend with no quality risk. Writers and default sub-agents keep the parent model.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.4
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.4
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.4

## 5.8.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Anthropic empty-args tool calls and underscore-path project discovery. Truncated tool-input JSON now surfaces as a retryable parse error instead of emitting a phantom `args:{}` call, and eager/fine-grained tool streaming is gated behind a default-off flag. Project discovery reads the real cwd from ggcoder session headers, so projects whose path contains an underscore no longer vanish from the picker.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.3

## 5.8.2

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.8.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.8.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.8.2

## 5.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Session resume now renders 1:1 with the live transcript: stale autopilot all-clear markers are deduped and range-clamped (no more duplicate Ken bubbles bunching at the bottom of reopened sessions), queued steering prompts resume as clean bubbles without the internal wrapper, Ken "Send to GG Coder" labels, enhancer highlights, plan-mode banners, task headers, error rows, and compaction counts all persist and restore, and all-clear wording is deterministic across reopens.

- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.7.0

## 5.6.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix duplicate session files created on every resume — resuming now appends to the original session file instead of forking a byte-identical copy each time.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.6.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.6.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.6.3

## 5.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Optimize Ken mentor/autopilot prompt caching: fold static project context (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) into the cached system prompt instead of resending it uncached every turn, and force long cache retention on Ken sessions independent of the user's global speed profile.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.6.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.6.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.6.2

## 5.6.1

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.6.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.6.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.6.1

## 5.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Autopilot Ken now has an IGNORE verdict for turns that were never real work (small talk, answered questions, mechanical git ops like commit/push), so trivial turns no longer produce a pointless "all clear" in the transcript.

### Patch Changes

- @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.6.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.6.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.6.0

## 5.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix subagent tool allow-list crashing in the desktop app: the JSON-mode arg parser in `app-sidecar.ts` was missing the `--tools` flag, so any named agent with a `tools:` allow-list (bee, owl, researcher, worker) failed to spawn with "Unknown option '--tools'".
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.5.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.5.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.5.1

## 5.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add autopilot Ken auto-review loop: after each turn a separate read-only Ken reviewer judges the work and either sends GG Coder back in with a fresh prompt, calls it all-clear, or flags for a human. Also auto-prune completed tasks from the sidecar task list.

### Patch Changes

- @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.5.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.5.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.5.0

## 5.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Enforce subagent `tools:` frontmatter as an allowlist, raise the subagent turn cap to 50 with a clear cut-off signal when it's hit, and phrase `/init` and task-handoff notices for the gg-app UI instead of CLI keybinds.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.4.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.4.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.4.3

## 5.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Auto-continue once when a tool call fails 3x with completely empty arguments (a provider stream glitch, not a model schema mistake), and correctly attribute the resulting error to the provider instead of mislabeling it a ggcoder bug.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.4.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.4.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.4.2

## 5.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix gg-app auto-compaction not reserving headroom for a model's real output budget (e.g. GPT-5.5 over Codex OAuth: 272K window, up to 128K output), which let context grow until the provider rejected the turn with "exceeds the context window"; also fix the app's context-window footer to use the correct transport-specific window (Codex OAuth vs public API).
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.4.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.4.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.4.1

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Re-enable Claude Fable 5 in the model selector, and show clean, provider-attributed error messages (headline + guidance + reset time for usage limits) instead of raw JSON error blobs from providers like Xiaomi MiMo.

### Patch Changes

- @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.4.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.4.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.4.0

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Xiaomi MiMo-V2.5-Pro-UltraSpeed, served over a separate API Credits endpoint. Xiaomi auth now supports both the existing Token Plan key and a new API Credits key — `mimo-v2.5-pro`/`mimo-v2.5` prefer the Token Plan and fall back to API Credits when that's all that's configured, while UltraSpeed requires API Credits. `ggcoder login` and the desktop login modal both let you choose which endpoint to authenticate with.

- @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.3.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.3.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.3.0

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`, 1M context, 128k output, adaptive thinking) replacing Sonnet 4.6, and fix the Anthropic non-streaming fallback so it no longer trips the SDK's "Streaming is required for operations that may take longer than 10 minutes" pre-flight throw on large max_tokens.

### Patch Changes

- @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.2.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.2.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.2.0

## 5.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Add a tool-steering clause that nudges the model to batch independent read-only calls (read, grep, ls, find) into one turn, cutting round-trips since tool execution is already parallel.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.1.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.1.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.1.2

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix the gg-app Ken mentor sidecar so it follows model switches after it has been created.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@5.1.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.1.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.1.1

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Ken Kai, a read-only mentor agent: a second AgentSession scoped by an `allowedTools` allow-list plus an `allowedMcpServers` whitelist (kencode-search) so it can research real code but never mutate the repo, with its advisory turns persisted alongside the build session as non-LLM custom entries that survive resume and compaction.

- @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@5.1.0
- @kenkaiiii/gg-core@5.1.0

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- Remove the `ggcoder pixel` error-tracking command and all gg-pixel SDK packages (breaking CLI change), and add test-drift detection to the ideal-review hook so editing a source file whose sibling test was left untouched now prompts the agent to update the stale test.

## 4.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `code_search` AST-aware tool (TS/JS symbol chunking + BM25 ranking) and opt-in hashline anchors for read/edit (stale-edit rejection via line+hash guard).

## 4.14.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix queued messages overriding the original task: mid-run steering prompts are now framed as concurrent instructions so the agent folds them into the current work instead of abandoning the original objective.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.14.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.14.3

## 4.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Add prompt-enhancer sidecar capability with project-stack-aware terminology, and harden image attachments — malformed/unsupported images (e.g. a bad .ico) now degrade to a file note instead of failing the whole turn.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.14.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.14.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.14.2

## 4.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix Anthropic 1h prompt-cache TTL by sending the extended-cache-ttl beta header on the streaming and prewarm paths, so `cacheRetention: "long"` no longer silently falls back to the 5-minute default.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.14.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.14.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.14.1

## 4.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Sakana Fugu provider (Fugu, Fugu Ultra) with API-key login, high/xhigh reasoning, and a silent-reasoning stream-timeout extension.

## 4.13.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix orphaned queued messages after an abort — drain the post-abort queue even when the run was interrupted, so a reprompt during async teardown isn't stranded.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.13.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.13.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.13.3

## 4.13.2

### Patch Changes

- Add tool-call and error logging to the gg-app sidecar event bridge so fatal "invalid tool arguments" aborts leave a forensic trail in `~/.gg/gg-app-sidecar.log` (tool name, isError, result preview, and agent error events) instead of failing silently.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.13.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.13.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.13.2

## 4.13.1

### Patch Changes

- Spawn dependency-backed stdio MCP servers (e.g. the default kencode-search)
  directly via `node <binScript>` instead of `npx -y <pkg>`, removing the ~100 MB
  `npm exec` wrapper process per MCP connection. Non-dependency / non-npx servers
  pass through unchanged.

  Also ships content-aware compression for bash/task_output truncation (preserves
  errors over blind tail slices) and the gg-app shared-daemon backend refactor.

## 4.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Update system prompt talk section for ADHD-readable responses

  Rewrite `renderTalkSection()` so every reply leads with the outcome word
  (Fixed/Done/Broken/Failed), enforces bottom-line-first scanning, one idea
  per line, pick-don't-menu, concrete metrics, no unresolved it-depends, and
  affirmative phrasing. Designed for fast scanning and low working memory.

## 4.12.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix Windows sidecar crash: the session-folder name encoder (`encodeCwd`) now strips Windows extended-length path prefixes (`\\?\` and `\\?\UNC\`) and all reserved filename characters (`<>:"|?*`). Previously, Windows canonicalized cwds (`\\?\C:\Users\brams`) produced illegal folder names containing `?`, causing `mkdir` ENOENT and a fatal sidecar crash on startup — blocking OAuth/login for all Windows users.

## 4.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Add performance benchmarks and optimize streaming, tool execution, and rendering pipeline
  - edit-diff: lazy normalization cache for fuzzy matching (5-7× faster on large files)
  - ls: parallel stat() via Promise.all (3.7-5.5× faster on large dirs)
  - StreamResult: backpressure with high/low-water marks to bound memory (10× reduction)
  - agent-loop: mixed-mode tool execution batches consecutive parallel-safe tools (2-10× faster)
  - agent-loop: per-tool timeout isolation via AbortSignal.any (prevents indefinite hangs)
  - agent-loop: gate diagnostic char-counting behind \_diagFn (eliminates per-turn overhead)
  - Markdown.tsx: block-level memoization via marked.lexer (only active block re-parses)
  - App.tsx: requestAnimationFrame-throttled appendAssistant (5-10× fewer re-renders)
  - benchmarks: full harness with before/after comparison tables (pnpm bench)

## 4.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add generate_image tool: generate and edit images via OpenAI gpt-image-2 through the Codex backend. Conditionally registered when OpenAI is connected. Includes inline image preview in transcript, shimmering skeleton placeholder during generation, 1:1 history reconstruction for tool-produced images and sub-agent groups on session resume, and image path exposure for multi-turn editing.

## 4.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 1c37b11: Persist model + thinking selection per-project (per window) across app restarts.

  Previously every window's sidecar wrote its model choice to a single shared
  `defaultModel`/`defaultProvider` slot in `~/.gg/settings.json`, so switching a
  model in one window clobbered the selection for all others — and on restart
  every window defaulted to the last-written model (or fell back to the provider
  default when that provider wasn't logged in). Model + thinking preferences are
  now stored keyed by project cwd in `~/.gg/gg-app.json` and read first on boot;
  the global slot is kept only as a fallback for never-opened projects.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.11.2
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.11.2

## 4.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix sub-agents hanging until timeout when spawned from a host whose `argv[1]`
  isn't the CLI entry (e.g. the desktop app's sidecar). The subagent tool now
  resolves `dist/cli.js` relative to its own module instead of trusting
  `process.argv[1]`, so sub-agents run and stream NDJSON correctly in every host.

## 4.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix duplicated transcript text and random whitespace in the terminal UI. The
  bottom-pinned shrink-backfill repaint reconstructed the on-screen transcript by
  re-serializing history (markdown re-render + wrapAnsi); when a row's visual
  width diverged from the terminal (wide emoji, bold/italic markdown, CJK) the
  rebuilt row count disagreed with ink's frame math, causing the repaint to
  overlap still-present rows (duplicate lines) or pad short with blank rows
  (injected whitespace). It fired on nearly every turn. The repaint is now
  disabled by default — ink falls back to a cursor-up pad-consume that never
  repaints content — eliminating both failure modes. Opt back in with
  `GG_SHRINK_BACKFILL=1`. Also adds `[scrollback]` debug logging across every
  native-scrollback write path.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.10.2

## 4.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix `ggcoder continue` resuming the newest-created session instead of the one you last spoke in (now sorts by last-message activity), and fix inline-image scrollback corruption (base64 spew, duplicated lines, and misaligned images) by bailing the shrink-backfill text repaint when the transcript contains an image.

## 4.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Update Kimi to K2.7 (`kimi-k2.7-code`) as the Moonshot default model, replacing Kimi K2.6 across the registry, CLI, login UI, and docs.

  Harden Kimi OAuth token refresh so it no longer silently falls back to a paid Moonshot API key: refresh reuses the existing refresh token when the server doesn't rotate it, tokens are renewed proactively before expiry (60s skew), `baseUrl` is preserved across refreshes, and a genuinely-dead OAuth credential now logs a warning instead of switching billing silently.

## 4.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix blank rows being reserved above short live content during streaming. The
  live-area height estimate over-counted non-text rows (slash-command info lines,
  tool/step markers), which falsely clamped the live area to its full budget and
  bottom-anchored the content — leaving a block of empty rows above it until the
  rows flushed to history. The estimate is now biased low; Ink's
  clipFrameToTerminalHeight remains the authoritative overflow backstop.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.9.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.9.1
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.9.1

## 4.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add LSP inline diagnostics to the edit/write tools. Successful edits now append
  compiler-grade error diagnostics (`Diagnostics in src/a.ts (informational …):
L42:7 Type 'string' is not assignable …`) so the model self-corrects type errors
  in the same turn. `typescript-language-server` + `typescript` ship bundled, so
  TS/JS diagnostics work for every user with zero setup; Python/Go/Rust/C servers
  are auto-detected from the project or PATH when present. Servers spawn lazily,
  are time-budgeted, and degrade silently — output is byte-identical when no server
  is available. Opt out with `"lspDiagnostics": false` in `~/.gg/settings.json`.

## 4.8.7

### Patch Changes

- Fix the intermittent blank-row block appearing right before the agent's final response: the patched ink's bottom-anchor pad debt left over from a run-end frame shrink is now reclaimed when the anchor deactivates (ink fork 6.8.0-gg.2). Also: oversized flushed assistant prefixes leave live state immediately, and null-rendering items no longer inflate the live-area clamp estimate.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.8.7
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.8.7
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.7

## 4.8.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix message vanish on slash-command submit: queueFlush now mirrors flushed rows into sessionStore.history synchronously so the patched ink's bottom-pinned repaint (menu close, resize) redraws from a current transcript. Also track /theme switches live so closure-level repaint serializers always use the active theme, not the startup theme.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.8.6
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.8.6
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.6

## 4.8.5

### Patch Changes

- Ship the patched Ink rendering engine to npm installs. The TUI's footer-anchor and scrollback fixes live in a patched ink build that pnpm's patchedDependencies only applied inside the workspace — npm users silently got vanilla ink. ggcoder's ink dependency is now an npm alias to the published @kenkaiiii/ink fork, so every install (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) gets the fixed renderer with no install scripts.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.8.5
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.5

## 4.8.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix footer jumps and scrollback whitespace/duplication in the scrollback-mode TUI. The patched Ink now folds transcript flushes atomically into frame writes (insertBeforeFrame), anchors the frame bottom with reclaimable pad debt while the agent runs, clips frames to terminal height, and repaints in place (cursor home + eraseDown) for bottom-pinned idle height changes like the slash-command menu — so the footer stays pinned, responses have no phantom gaps, and scrollback receives no duplicate banner/prompt copies.

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.8.4
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.4

## 4.8.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix oversized pinned assistant items being cut off in the live area: flush tall finalized items (cumulative over the pinned set) to scrollback, and keep the height-clamp slice from starting on a blank line so the ⏺ prefix stays aligned.
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-ai@4.8.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-agent@4.8.3
  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.3

## 4.8.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix TUI scrollback corruption from streaming markdown tables and inline images: table-aware live-region row estimation, pending-table height clamping and partial-row hold-back in the markdown renderer, and fixed-height inline image blocks so Ink's live-frame erase math stays in sync (no more orphaned ⏺ rows).

  - @kenkaiiii/gg-core@4.8.2

## 4.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix ENOSPC crash when session transcript writes fail (disk full) — persistence now fails soft with a one-time warning instead of killing the live session. Add automatic session transcript pruning via new `sessionRetentionDays` setting (default 30 days, 0 disables).

## 4.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `task_send` tool for interactive control of background processes. Background processes started with `run_in_background` now spawn with a stdin pipe, and the agent can answer prompts, drive REPLs, and feed scaffolders via `task_send` (with optional Enter/EOF), pairing with the existing `task_output`/`task_stop` tools.

## 4.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Xiaomi MiMo-V2.5 models with native video analysis. The text-only
  `mimo-v2.5-pro` is now the Xiaomi default, and the omnimodal `mimo-v2.5`
  supports native image and video understanding. Video read through the read
  tool is now delivered to MiMo (and other non-Moonshot OpenAI-compatible video
  models) in a follow-up user message as inline base64 `video_url`, the shape
  the API accepts — fixing the fallback where the model resorted to ffmpeg frame
  extraction. The read tool is also rebuilt on model switch so its video
  capability tracks the active model.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add native video analysis for Kimi K2.6, Gemini, and MiniMax. Attached and read videos are sent to the model in its required format (Kimi file-service upload, Gemini inlineData, MiniMax base64), with per-model size caps and automatic ffmpeg compression for oversized clips. Non-video models now show a clean "this model can't analyze video" message instead of an opaque provider error, and Kimi OAuth login was fixed to pass the coding-endpoint client identity.
