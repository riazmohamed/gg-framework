# /goal system final original-prompt audit

Reference: [original-goal-prompt] asked for an audit of the `/goal` system while literally using it, with fixes for encountered issues, simplification for future agents, and domain-agnostic A-Z flow for LLM consumption.

Scope of this final audit: source-backed review of the current candidate checkout, using the available durable artifacts and source/tests. The requested paths `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-token-audit.json` and `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-verification.log` were not present in this checkout. The closest available evidence is listed below and the missing requested names are treated as residual artifact-name drift, not as proof.

## Evidence files and commands checked

- `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-system-audit-report.md` — existing audit report and residual-risk boundary.
- `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-quality-audit.md` — source-backed findings GQA-001 through GQA-018 and current action status.
- `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-remediation-plan.md` — implementation-order ledger for the audit findings.
- `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-remediation-report.md` — remediation outcome and final proof boundary.
- `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-a-z-reliability-report.md` — A-Z reliability/leak matrix tied to [original-goal-prompt].
- `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-overhead-harness.json` — local token/overhead harness artifact generated in this worker.
- `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-system-audit-verifier.log` — current verifier output generated in this worker.
- Command run: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — exit 0; installed local dependencies needed for package scripts.
- Command run: `pnpm --dir packages/ggcoder exec tsx scripts/verify-goal-overhead-harness.ts` — exit 0; wrote overhead signals.
- Command run: `pnpm dlx tsx packages/ggcoder/scripts/verify-goal-system-audit.ts` — exit 1; targeted tests and typecheck passed, but the source-contract check `UI wires goals overlay and lifecycle` failed because the verifier expects the literal `GoalOverlay` token in `App.tsx` while current UI wiring uses Goal picker/status/continuation paths.

## Final section — answers to [original-goal-prompt]

### (1) Are there bottlenecks?

Yes, but the remaining source-backed bottlenecks are now mostly orchestration/proof-boundary bottlenecks rather than unbounded implementation blockers:

- **Provider-backed interactive TUI proof is still the largest bottleneck.** The local harnesses prove durable state/controller/verifier/event behavior, but the reports explicitly do not claim a real authenticated provider-backed terminal session with typed `/goal`, Ctrl+G, live worker, pane verifier, and final visual completion. This remains blocked on provider credentials/session, network/model availability, and permission to record redacted TUI artifacts.
- **GQA-002 remains a residual coordination bottleneck.** `goal-quality-audit.md` and `goal-remediation-report.md` record that `goals status`-first behavior is mitigated by prompts/events/tests, but not enforced by a hard first-tool-call gate.
- **Artifact/path naming is noisy.** The assigned final audit requested `goal-system-audit.md`, `goal-token-audit.json`, and `goal-verification.log`; those exact source artifacts were absent. Existing proof exists under `goal-system-audit-report.md`, `goal-remediation-report.md`, `goal-overhead-harness.json`, and `goal-system-audit-verifier.log`. This naming drift makes handoff harder for agents.
- **The current audit verifier has a stale/over-strict UI source-contract check.** It fails on the literal `GoalOverlay` expectation even while targeted Goal tests and package typecheck pass. This is a verifier maintenance bottleneck that should be fixed by aligning the source-contract check with the current UI implementation or restoring the expected exported token if that is the intended contract.

### (2) Is token usage good or overkill?

The measured local overhead is acceptable for complex goals but still heavy/overkill for simple goals.

Evidence from `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-overhead-harness.json`:

- Simple scenario: 4 stages, 10,585 prompt characters, 1 task, 0 blockers, 4 required proof gates.
- Complex scenario: 6 stages, 11,090 prompt characters, 8 tasks, 4 blockers, 14 required proof gates.
- Complex-to-simple prompt-character ratio: 1.05.

Interpretation: the system scales proof gates/tasks/blockers with complexity, which is good, but the fixed baseline is high: the simple scenario still carries the large goal-mode prompt and worker system prompt. For [original-goal-prompt]'s requirement that humans only set `/goal <task>` and agents consume the rest, this is safer than under-specifying proof, but it is not minimal. A future simplification should compact repeated coordinator/worker instructions into shorter durable references once a run already has criteria, evidence plan, verifier, and mandatory references stored.

### (3) Can agents actively identify, fix, and complete issues easily?

Mostly yes for local/source-backed issues, with the caveat that stale verifier contracts and missing artifact names slow the final handoff.

Evidence-backed positives:

- `goal-quality-audit.md` identifies concrete issues GQA-001 through GQA-018 with severity, confidence, source evidence, repro/proof, recommendations, and action status.
- `goal-remediation-plan.md` translates findings into implementation files, priority, dependencies, and required tests/proof.
- `goal-remediation-report.md` records that the major false-positive completion, evidence-plan, final-audit, lifecycle, store, pause/resume, synthetic-event, prerequisite, and canonical-verifier gaps were fixed or explicitly deferred.
- The current `verify-goal-system-audit.ts` run proves targeted Goal behavior tests passed and `pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder check` passed before failing on one source-contract string check.

Remaining friction:

- Agents can fix code and record evidence, but finalization is harder when assigned artifact names differ from existing artifacts.
- A failing verifier check must clearly distinguish real product failure from stale verifier expectation. The current failure does not prove tests/typecheck failed; it proves the source-contract expectation for UI wiring no longer matches literal source text.

### (4) Does it flow agent-to-agent A-to-Z for domain-agnostic LLM consumption?

Structurally yes for deterministic local/source-backed goals; not fully proven for live provider-backed TUI goals.

Source-backed flow that exists now:

1. `/goal` setup captures the original objective/reference requirements and durable proof plan instead of immediately implementing.
2. Durable Goal state tracks criteria, prerequisites, evidence plan, harnesses, tasks, verifier, evidence, blockers, and final audit data.
3. Controller decisions gate worker launch, prerequisite blocking, verifier execution, evidence reconciliation, retries/fixes, final audit, and completion.
4. Workers are prompted to produce candidate packets and durable evidence.
5. Verifier and final audit gates are required before completion.
6. Reports and harnesses cover broad domain-agnostic scenarios rather than hardcoding a specific app/backend/UI domain.

The A-Z ideal is still bounded by these residual risks:

- Provider-backed live TUI behavior is unproven locally.
- Coordinator `goals status`-first remains not hard-enforced.
- Token overhead is front-loaded and may be overkill for small/simple goals.
- The verifier contract needs maintenance so final workers are not blocked by stale literal source checks.

## Remaining risks/blockers

- Missing requested artifacts in this checkout: `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-token-audit.json` and `packages/ggcoder/docs/goal-verification.log`.
- Current verifier result: fail, exit 1, because `packages/ggcoder/scripts/verify-goal-system-audit.ts` reports `FAIL UI wires goals overlay and lifecycle`; see `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-system-audit-verifier.log`.
- Provider-backed interactive proof remains blocked without user-provided authenticated provider/session, network/model availability, and permission to capture redacted logs/screenshots.
- This final audit intentionally does not mark the whole Goal complete; the orchestrator/verifier must decide whether the stale verifier contract needs a follow-up fix before completion.
