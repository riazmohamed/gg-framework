# /goal Remediation Report

Date: 2026-05-23

## Outcome

The remediation pass is complete for the local/source-backed remediation scope and the requested local verifier chain passes. The durable verifier log is stored at `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-remediation-verifier.log`.

This report intentionally distinguishes **automated local proof** from **untested provider-backed interactive TUI behavior**. The automated proof covers source contracts, unit/integration tests, local E2E harness behavior, typecheck, lint, format check, and build. It does not prove a live paid/credentialed provider session in the terminal UI.

## Fixed findings

- GQA-001: setup-quality enforcement now blocks incomplete setup from silently looking ready; tests cover minimal/rich create behavior and controller completion blocking.
- GQA-003: evidence-plan satisfaction now uses stronger explicit evidence-plan readiness/path/command proof instead of short generic substring matches; negative and positive controller tests cover this.
- GQA-004: passing final completion audits now require a concrete `FINAL_AUDIT_PASS` contract with the latest verifier timestamp and artifact reference; tool and smoke tests cover rejection/acceptance.
- GQA-005/GQA-006/GQA-017: worker/verifier lifecycle coverage now includes timeout/process cleanup and worker-owned dev-server lifecycle behavior.
- GQA-007: verifier result evidence labeling is normalized/covered across tool/UI paths.
- GQA-008/GQA-009: store durability protections are covered by store tests, including active-run preservation/concurrency-oriented behavior.
- GQA-010/GQA-011/GQA-018: pause/resume/blocker semantics and blocker dedupe are covered in goals/tool tests.
- GQA-012/GQA-013: synthetic event fallback parsing and lifecycle orchestration single-flight behavior are covered by UI event/orchestration tests.
- GQA-014/GQA-015: canonical goal verifier scripts exist and pass: `verify:goal:tests`, `verify:goal:e2e`, and `scripts/verify-goal-system-audit.ts`.
- GQA-016: prerequisite check-command safety is covered by prerequisite tests.

## Deferred/residual findings

- GQA-002 remains partially prompt/orchestration-governed: coordinator freshness is mitigated through synthetic event instructions, durable-state orchestration tests, and the local E2E harness, but a hard first-tool-call enforcer was not added.
- A fully interactive human TUI proof (`/goal` typed in the terminal, Ctrl+G opened, provider-backed worker observed in the TUI, verifier run from the pane, and final completion observed visually) was not performed in this worker; the proof path is local automated unit/E2E/source-contract verification.
- Provider-backed worker execution requires external prerequisites not available to the deterministic local harness: valid provider credentials/session, network access, and a selected model/provider that can spawn a real worker. No secrets, env dumps, or credential-dependent output are recorded in these reports.

## Commands run

```sh
pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder test -- src/core/goal-controller.test.ts src/tools/goals.test.ts src/core/goal-store.test.ts src/core/goal-prerequisites.test.ts src/core/goal-verifier.test.ts src/core/goal-worker.test.ts src/core/goal-worker-dev-server-lifecycle.test.ts src/tools/goal-mode.test.ts src/ui/goal-events.test.ts src/ui/goal-lifecycle-orchestration.test.ts src/ui/goal-overlay.test.ts src/ui/goal-status-bar.test.ts src/system-prompt.test.ts src/core/prompt-commands.test.ts --reporter=dot

pnpm dlx tsx packages/ggcoder/scripts/verify-goal-system-audit.ts
pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder check
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder build
```

## Evidence

- `packages/ggcoder/.goal-evidence/goal-remediation-verifier.log`: full requested verifier chain output, exit code 0.
- Targeted test phase: 58 files / 704 tests passed.
- E2E harness: `Goal lifecycle harness passed: prerequisites blocked, evidence planned/blocked, worker and verifier events parsed, verifier fail fixes, ready run verifies, final audit gates completion, complete run completes.`
- System audit verifier: all source-contract checks passed.
- TypeScript check, lint, format check, and package build all passed.

## Residual risks

The automated proof is strong for durable goal state, controller gates, evidence-plan reconciliation, worker/verifier lifecycle, and final audit semantics. Remaining risk is primarily interactive/environmental: a real terminal UI session and provider-backed worker behavior can still expose timing, display, authentication, rate-limit, or model-compliance issues not covered by the local harnesses.

## Operator follow-up for provider-backed interactive proof

Run this only in an environment where provider access is already configured; do not paste secrets into logs or reports.

1. From the package/project root, confirm local automated proof remains green:
   - `pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder verify:goal:tests`
   - `pnpm --filter @kenkaiiii/ggcoder verify:goal:e2e`
   - `pnpm dlx tsx packages/ggcoder/scripts/verify-goal-system-audit.ts`
2. Start `ggcoder` with an already-authenticated provider/model.
3. Type a small reversible `/goal` objective in a disposable temp project.
4. Open the Goal pane with `/goals` or `Ctrl+G`; press `r` to run/continue.
5. Observe that a provider-backed worker is launched, durable worker logs/evidence are written under the configured Goal store, and the UI status/overlay updates without duplicate continuation.
6. Run the verifier from the pane (`v`) or continue until the configured verifier runs.
7. Confirm the run does not reach passed status until evidence-plan items are ready/proven and a final `FINAL_AUDIT_PASS` audit has been recorded after the latest verifier pass.
8. Record only project-relative artifact paths, redacted screenshots/log excerpts if needed, and whether the provider-backed run passed or which external prerequisite blocked it.
