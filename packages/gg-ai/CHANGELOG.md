### Minor Changes

- bc99e74: **GLM-5.3 is now the only GLM model.** Z.AI's new coding-first flagship (released 2026-08-14) replaces GLM-5.2, and GLM-5.1 / GLM-4.7 / GLM-4.7 Flash are retired from the registry — they routed to strictly worse coding for the same plan quota, and the coding endpoint already answers `glm-5.2` requests as glm-5.3. Sessions saved on any retired id fall back to the provider default.

  Same GLM-5 base as 5.2 with every gain from post-training: Z.AI reports ~50% better coding and open-source SOTA on Terminal-Bench 3.0 and Agent's Last Exam. Context window (1M) and max output (131K) are unchanged, so compaction budgeting is untouched.

  **GLM thinking is now a real effort ladder, not an on/off toggle.** ggcoder previously sent only `thinking: { type: "enabled" }`, which silently ran Z.AI's `max` default at every setting. The endpoint in fact declares `none, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max` (an unknown value 400s with that list), so `low / medium / high / xhigh / max` are now selectable and sent as `reasoning_effort` alongside the toggle. Measured end-to-end on one hard reasoning prompt: `low` → 0.8K reasoning chars in 15s, `high` → 3.2K in 28s, `max` → 24.9K in 129s. The default stays `max`, matching what the server was already doing, so existing behaviour is unchanged — but dialing effort _down_ is now possible for the first time.

  Note `max` is kept as `max` on the wire for GLM rather than remapped to `xhigh` the way OpenAI-compatible efforts are: GLM spells its own top rung `max`.

  With no low-cost GLM sibling left, compaction-summary and scout sub-agent routing keep GLM-5.3 instead of downshifting — the existing graceful fallback, no crash and no cross-provider jump.

### Patch Changes

- 8e124fd: Fix "no low surrogate in string" / Bad Request errors from Anthropic and OpenAI.

  An unpaired UTF-16 surrogate anywhere in the conversation (a model streaming a
  split emoji inside tool-call arguments, or a character-indexed truncation that
  cut an astral character in half) made the JSON request body unparseable for
  every provider — and it persisted in history, so retries and model switches
  failed identically.

  `stream()` now scrubs lone surrogates from all messages at the single provider
  boundary, and the tool-result/shell/web-fetch/grep truncation paths cut on
  character boundaries instead of splitting surrogate pairs.

### Minor Changes

- a6a78c2: Add Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`, released 2026-07-24) to the model registry — 1M context, 128k output, image input, adaptive thinking with the full effort ladder (low→max, xhigh included), $5/$25 MTok (same price as Opus 4.8). gg-ai treats it as an adaptive-thinking model (no interleaved-thinking beta, xhigh passes through), footers short-name it "Opus" (Opus 4.8 becomes "Opus 4.8"), login/provider descriptions mention it, and gg-boss's default boss model moves from `claude-opus-4-8` to `claude-opus-5`. Opus 4.8 stays registered as a legacy option.

### Patch Changes

- Reliability fixes from the baseline harness (bench/baseline):
  - **Truncated-stream guard (gg-ai):** a clean stream close with no terminal event (no `message_stop` / `finish_reason`) now throws a retryable `ProviderError(504)` instead of silently returning partial text as a phantom-complete `end_turn`. Applies to both the Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers.
  - **Sidecar bounds (ggcoder):** inbound HTTP bodies capped at 10 MB (413) via `readCappedBody`; the `~/.gg` progress `fs.watch` handle is now closed on shutdown; the project-file glob search streams and bails after 50k entries. Closes three unbounded-memory/leak paths.
  - **Cap-divergence marker (gg-agent):** `capToolResults`/`capTurnToolResults` now stamp `ToolResult.capped = { originalChars, keptChars, scope }` when they trim, so the event-transcript vs model-input divergence is programmatically visible. Internal metadata only — never serialized to the provider.
  - **Empty-part serializer fix (gg-ai):** `toAnthropicMessages` no longer emits empty text parts (user `""`, user `{text:""}`, settled assistant `""`), eliminating live Anthropic 400 "text content blocks must be non-empty" failures.
  - **Tool-id remap fix (gg-ai):** `remapToolCallId` now strips the full `toolu_` prefix (`slice(6)`), mapping `toolu_01ABC` → clean `call_01ABC` instead of the lossy double-underscore `call__01ABC`.

### Minor Changes

- Update system prompt talk section for ADHD-readable responses

  Rewrite `renderTalkSection()` so every reply leads with the outcome word
  (Fixed/Done/Broken/Failed), enforces bottom-line-first scanning, one idea
  per line, pick-don't-menu, concrete metrics, no unresolved it-depends, and
  affirmative phrasing. Designed for fast scanning and low working memory.

## 4.12.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix Windows sidecar crash: the session-folder name encoder (`encodeCwd`) now strips Windows extended-length path prefixes (`\\?\` and `\\?\UNC\`) and all reserved filename characters (`<>:"|?*`). Previously, Windows canonicalized cwds (`\\?\C:\Users\brams`) produced illegal folder names containing `?`, causing `mkdir` ENOENT and a fatal sidecar crash on startup — blocking OAuth/login for all Windows users.

## 4.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Add performance benchmarks and optimize streaming, tool execution, and rendering pipeline
  - edit-diff: lazy normalization cache for fuzzy matching (5-7× faster on large files)
  - ls: parallel stat() via Promise.all (3.7-5.5× faster on large dirs)
  - StreamResult: backpressure with high/low-water marks to bound memory (10× reduction)
  - agent-loop: mixed-mode tool execution batches consecutive parallel-safe tools (2-10× faster)
  - agent-loop: per-tool timeout isolation via AbortSignal.any (prevents indefinite hangs)
  - agent-loop: gate diagnostic char-counting behind \_diagFn (eliminates per-turn overhead)
  - Markdown.tsx: block-level memoization via marked.lexer (only active block re-parses)
  - App.tsx: requestAnimationFrame-throttled appendAssistant (5-10× fewer re-renders)
  - benchmarks: full harness with before/after comparison tables (pnpm bench)

## 4.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add generate_image tool: generate and edit images via OpenAI gpt-image-2 through the Codex backend. Conditionally registered when OpenAI is connected. Includes inline image preview in transcript, shimmering skeleton placeholder during generation, 1:1 history reconstruction for tool-produced images and sub-agent groups on session resume, and image path exposure for multi-turn editing.

### Minor Changes

- Update Kimi to K2.7 (`kimi-k2.7-code`) as the Moonshot default model, replacing Kimi K2.6 across the registry, CLI, login UI, and docs.

  Harden Kimi OAuth token refresh so it no longer silently falls back to a paid Moonshot API key: refresh reuses the existing refresh token when the server doesn't rotate it, tokens are renewed proactively before expiry (60s skew), `baseUrl` is preserved across refreshes, and a genuinely-dead OAuth credential now logs a warning instead of switching billing silently.

## 4.7.0

## 4.6.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Anthropic rejecting foreign `raw` content blocks (e.g. OpenAI Codex encrypted reasoning items) when switching a session to an Anthropic model. Raw blocks whose wire type isn't a valid Anthropic input content block are now dropped on the way out.

## 4.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix OpenAI OAuth account switching by adding prompt=login to authorize URL. Previously, re-running `ggcoder login` with OpenAI would silently re-approve the cached browser session, preventing users from switching accounts.

## 4.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix provider stream cancellation and usage-limit handling, and sanitize Codex tool-call IDs when continuing sessions across model transports.

## 4.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Xiaomi MiMo-V2.5 models with native video analysis. The text-only
  `mimo-v2.5-pro` is now the Xiaomi default, and the omnimodal `mimo-v2.5`
  supports native image and video understanding. Video read through the read
  tool is now delivered to MiMo (and other non-Moonshot OpenAI-compatible video
  models) in a follow-up user message as inline base64 `video_url`, the shape
  the API accepts — fixing the fallback where the model resorted to ffmpeg frame
  extraction. The read tool is also rebuilt on model switch so its video
  capability tracks the active model.

## 4.5.0

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e381ad: Extract `@kenkaiiii/gg-core` — a provider-agnostic, UI-free shared foundation
  that owns the model registry, thinking levels, app paths, OAuth + auth storage,
  the file-writer logger core, telegram + voice transcription, and the
  self-updater. ggcoder, gg-boss, and gg-editor now inherit a single source of
  truth for provider-coupled code instead of maintaining duplicates.

  Move provider-error classification into `@kenkaiiii/gg-ai` as
  `classifyProviderError`, reconciled with `isHardBillingMessage` so billing
  wording lives in one place.
