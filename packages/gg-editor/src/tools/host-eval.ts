/**
 * Escape hatch — runs arbitrary host-native scripting code with the live NLE
 * objects pre-bound. Routes to whichever adapter is connected:
 *
 *   - Resolve  → Python via the long-lived bridge sidecar
 *   - Premiere → ExtendScript via the JSX bridge
 *   - none     → returns `error: not_supported` (no host attached)
 *
 * **Use this only when no named tool covers what you need.** The named tools
 * have validation, output shaping, capability fallbacks, and EDL/FCPXML
 * bulk-paths this raw eval skips entirely. If a named tool exists for what
 * you're doing, use the named tool.
 *
 * Pre-bound globals on Resolve (Python):
 *   - `resolve`, `project`, `projectManager`, `mediaPool`, `mediaStorage`
 *   - `timeline`, `fusion`, `dvr` (the DaVinciResolveScript module)
 *   - `set_result(value)` — return JSON-serialisable data to the agent
 *   - `result` — alternative: assign at top level
 *   - `print(...)` — captured to `stdout`
 *
 * Pre-bound globals on Premiere (ExtendScript):
 *   - `app`, `project`, `sequence`, `qe` (Quality Engineering DOM, undocumented)
 *   - `setResult(value)` — return JSON-serialisable data
 *   - `result` — alternative: assign at top level
 *   - `print(...)` — captured to `stdout`
