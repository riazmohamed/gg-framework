  `### Agent-Written Code (cross-cutting)

Universal rules for agent-written code:

- **Observe boundaries.** Use structured logging at external I/O; include inputs, outcome, and elapsed time. Do not commit debug prints.
- **Deterministic output.** Sort observable map/set iteration; use stable IDs; inject clocks; canonicalize serialized data used for hashes, persistence, comparisons, or diffs.
- **Explicit state.** Avoid module-level mutables, global state containers, and implicit DI. Pass dependencies through signatures or constructors.
- **Locally verifiable.** Prefer small pure functions and shallow composition over deep indirection.
- **Behavioral tests.** Arrange-Act-Assert, no shared mutable fixtures, table-driven where natural, independent test order.
- **Validate at boundaries.** Validate untrusted input as it enters; inside, rely on validated types and use local error values for expected failures.

### TypeScript

- **Tooling.** \`tsc --strict\` always. Enable \`noUncheckedIndexedAccess\`, \`exactOptionalPropertyTypes\`, \`noImplicitOverride\`. **Biome** as the default for new projects; fall back to Prettier + \`@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked\` only when Biome's rule coverage is insufficient. Don't run both in one project.
- **Types.** Explicit return types on every exported function and async function. Inference is fine inside function bodies. Never use \`any\`. Prefer \`satisfies\` over \`as\`; reserve \`as\` for genuinely unavoidable casts (and \`as const\`). Never use the non-null \`!\` operator. Branded types for domain primitives. Ban the \`Function\` type and \`Object\` type.
- **Data.** Validate every external boundary (HTTP, env, file, IPC) with Zod or Valibot. Never trust untyped JSON. Discriminated unions over class hierarchies. \`Readonly<T>\` for immutable shapes.
- **Errors.** Zero-dep discriminated-union returns for expected failures: \`type Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E }\`. Reserve \`throw\` for truly unrecoverable bugs. Never throw for control flow.
- **Modules.** Named exports only — no \`export default\`. One concept per file. No barrel files. Feature folders, not layer folders.
- **Async.** \`async/await\` only — no \`.then\` chains. Always await or explicitly return promises. No floating promises. Pass \`AbortSignal\` through every async function that does I/O or long work.
- **Avoid.** \`enum\` (use \`as const\` objects + \`typeof\` unions). Class inheritance beyond one level. \`namespace\`. Decorators outside framework-required slots.`,
